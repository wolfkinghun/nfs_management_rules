    S 1 GENERAL RULES
S1.1 Vehicle Condition
S1.1.1 Vehicles must be presented for judging in finished condition, fully assembled, complete and
ready-to-race.
S1.1.2 The judges will not evaluate any vehicle that is presented in what they consider to be an
unfinished state.
S1.1.3 Vehicles may be presented for judging without having passed technical inspection, even if
final tuning and setup is in progress.
S1.1.4 Covers and/or parts may be removed during the judging to facilitate access and presentation
of components or concepts.
S 2 BUSINESS PLAN PRESENTATION EVENT
S2.1 Business Plan Presentation Objective
S2.1.1 The objective of the BPP is to assess the team’s ability to develop and present a comprehensive
business model. This business model must offer a product or a service based on the team’s
specific prototype vehicle or a specific component of it, providing a rewarding business
opportunity that creates a monetary profit. The vehicle or component must be an essential
part of the value proposition.
S2.1.2 The judges should be treated as if they were potential investors or partners for the presented
business model.
S2.1.3 The quality of the actual prototype will not be considered as part of the BPP judging, therefore
S1.1 does not apply.
S2.2 Business Plan Presentation Procedure
S2.2.1 Presentations are limited to a maximum of 10 min. The judges will stop any presentation
exceeding 10 min.
S2.2.2 The presentation will not be interrupted by questions. Immediately following the presentation
there will be a question and answer session.
S2.2.3 One or more team members may present the business plan.

S2.2.4 All team members involved in the BPP must be in the podium area and must be introduced to
the judges at the beginning of the presentation. The team members who have been introduced
may answer the judges’ questions even if they were not actually presenting.
S2.2.5 Teams that fail to make their presentation within their assigned time period will receive zero
points for the BPP.
S2.2.6 Before the competition a specific deep dive topic, which has to be part of the 10 min
presentation, will be published on the competition website.
S2.3 Pitch Video
S2.3.1 To convince the potential investors or partners that the team’s presentation is worthy of
their time, it is required that a Business Plan Pitch Video (BPPV) is submitted before the
competition. The pitch video should be considered as the first impression of the business
idea and has to contain the relevant investment figures.
S2.3.2 The BPPV must be submitted online via the competition website, not later than the deadline
specified in the competition handbook.
S2.3.3 The BPPV must not exceed a length of 30 s and must be in a common video format, e.g. avi,
mpg, mp4, wmv.
S2.4 Business Plan Presentation Scoring
S2.4.1 The BPP will be evaluated on the categories specified in table 6.

Table 6: BPP evaluation categories
S2.4.2 If the business model presented does not relate to one of the areas listed within S2.1.1,
15 penaltypoints will be deducted from the team’s BPP scoring.
S2.4.3 The judging at the competition will start with an initial judging, where all teams are judged
by different judging groups.
S2.4.4 Some teams may be chosen to participate in the BPP finals to determine the BPP winner.
The BPP finals will be held separately from the initial judging and teams will be informed
about their participation during the event.
S2.4.5 The scoring of the BPP is based on the average of the scores given by each of the judges.

S2.4.6 The scoring for the non-finalist is calculated as followed:
BPP_SCORE = 70
Pteam
Pmax 
Pteam is the score awarded to the team
Pmax is the highest score awarded to any team not participating in the finals
S2.4.7 The scoring of the BPP finalists will vary from 75 to 71 points and is scored immediately
after the BPP finals by all judges.
S 3 COST AND MANUFACTURING EVENT
S3.1 Cost and Manufacturing Objective
S3.1.1 The objective of the cost and manufacturing event is to evaluate the team’s understanding
of the manufacturing processes, costs and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the
construction of a prototype vehicle. This includes trade off decisions between content and
cost, make or buy decisions and understanding the differences between prototype and mass
production.
S3.2 Cost and Manufacturing Procedure
S3.2.1 Prior to the competition, three Cost Report Documents (CRD), see S3.3, must be submitted
to the competition website by the deadline specified in the competition handbook.
S3.2.2 During the competition, a discussion with the judges will take place, next to the team’s
vehicle. The discussion is split into three parts:
S3.2.3 Part 1 “Bill of Material (BOM) Discussion”:
A discussion to evaluate the team’s ability to prepare an accurate engineering and manufacturing BOM for the complete vehicle. The team must prove the following:
• The specification of the vehicle in the CRD accurately reflects the vehicle brought to
the competition.
• The costs and emissions within the Costed Carbonized Bill of Material (CCBOM) part
of the BOM are correct and realistic.
• The manufacturing feasibility of the vehicle.
S3.2.4 Part 2 “Cost Understanding”:
A discussion to evaluate the general cost and manufacturing knowledge of the team.
S3.2.5 Part 3 “Real Case”:
A specific task to evaluate the cost and manufacturing knowledge in a certain field. The real
case task will be published on the competition website before the competition.
S3.2.6 The teams must present their vehicle to the judges at the designated time. Teams that miss
their time slot will score 0 points.
S3.2.7 Teams are allowed to bring electronic, handwritten or printed handouts, flip charts or similar
to the event, but the space available may be limited.

S3.3 Cost Report Documents
S3.3.1 The CRD consist of the following documents:
• The BOM, including CCBOM, created and submitted online on the competition
website
• The supporting material file, submitted as a pdf file to the competition website
• The cost and emissions explanation file, submitted as a pdf file to to the competition
website
S3.3.2 A changelog of the changes on the vehicle since the submission deadline of the CRD can be
presented to the judges at the BOM discussion. Missing parts of the BOM cannot be part of
the changelog.
S3.3.3 All CRD must be brought to the event discussion either as hard copy or as digital version.

S3.3.5 The team must ensure that at least two judges are able to review the CRD independently.
S3.3.6 The presented CRD must be identical to the submitted versions, otherwise 0 points will be
scored for the “BOM Discussion” part.
S3.4 Bill of Material
S3.4.1 The BOM is a sorted list of all vehicle parts.
S3.4.2 The BOM is structured as follows:
• The BOM is broken down into “systems”, see S3.4.7.
• Each “system” is broken down into “assemblies”, which are defined by the website
tool.
• Each “assembly” can optionally be broken down into “sub-assemblies”, which must
be defined by the team.
• Each “assembly” or “sub-assembly” is broken down into “parts”, which must be
defined by the team.
S3.4.3 The BOM must list all parts fitted to the prototype vehicle at any time during the competition.
S3.4.4 Only dry tires and wheels per T2.7.1 need to be included in the BOM.
S3.4.5 “Fasteners” are additional items necessary to assemble a “part” or “(sub-)assembly” and
should not be listed (e.g. DIN-931 hexagon screw, glue, tape, zip-tie, . . . ).
S3.4.6 A self-manufactured “fastener” is considered a “part”.
S3.4.7 The “systems” are:
• Autonomous System
• Brake System
• Chassis and Body
• Drivetrain
• Engine and Tractive System
• Grounded Low Voltage System
• Miscellaneous, Fit and Finish
• Steering System
• Suspension System
• Wheels, Wheel Bearings and Tires
S3.4.8 When adding “parts” to the BOM, the comments section should be reviewed thoroughly.
The chosen part name must clearly describe what is included. For example, if a spring is
included, the “part” should not be called “damper”.
S3.4.9 Only metric units must be used within the BOM.
S3.5 Costed Carbonized Bill of Material
S3.5.1 The manufacturing and assembly processes, actual costs and greenhouse gas emissions of all
parts from one or two systems of the BOM must be listed in the CCBOM.
S3.5.2 For 2025, a CCBOM for the “Steering System” must be submitted.
S3.5.3 Additional to the BOM, the CCBOM must:
• Include the actual associated manufacturing processes for each part as used for the
prototype vehicle.
• Include tooling (e.g. welding jigs, molds, patterns and dies).
• Include the actual costs of materials, fabrication, bought parts and assembly for each
part as used for the prototype vehicle.
• Include the system’s carbon footprint for each part, manufacturing and assembly
process of the prototype vehicle in Carbon Dioxide Equivalents (CO2e).
S3.5.4 Each constituent “part” of an “assembly” must be classified as “bought” or “made”.
S3.5.5 Additional to the structure of the BOM, in the CCBOM each “part” is broken down into
• “materials” used (e.g. aluminium)
• “processes” that describe the necessary steps for manufacturing
• “fasteners” used to assemble the part (if applicable)
• “tooling” required for manufacturing (if applicable)
• “overhead” for additional associated costs and emissions of manufacturing and assembly of a part that are not covered by the points above
S3.5.6 “Tooling” is the necessary tools used for transforming the “material” into the desired shape.
If production tooling is associated with processes that are specific to the part geometry, it
must be included. For example the dies to stamp out a chassis bracket are tooling.
S3.5.7 Hand or power tools must not be included.

S3.5.8 For “bought parts”, only fasteners have to be included (if applicable). If the part was modified,
the associated “processes” and “tooling” (if applicable) for this modification must also be
included.
S3.5.9 Only parts that can be bought from a catalog may be designated as “bought parts”.
S3.5.10 The cost calculations must be completed as realistically as possible and exclude research,
development and capital expenditures for real estates (e.g. plant or development hours of the
team).
S3.5.11 All costs must be displayed in EUR. For calculating the prices in EUR from other currencies,
the team must provide the exchange rates used.
S3.5.12 There is no maximum cost. Receipts are not required for any items.
S3.5.13 The calculations for machine hourly rates, wages (including overheads) etc. must be shown.
S3.5.14 The “carbon footprint” is calculated in CO2e based on a “Cradle-to-Gate” Life Cycle
Assessment (LCA) of the selected “system(s)”.
S3.5.15 The “Cradle-to-Gate” analysis includes extraction of raw materials needed, manufacturing of
“made parts”, “sub-assemblies” and “assemblies” as well as manufacturing of the “system”
(ready to be mounted into the final prototype vehicle).
S3.5.16 For “bought parts”, only the “carbon footprint” of modifications has to be included.
S3.5.17 The “carbon footprint” for the the transportation between the steps must be included.
S3.5.18 The “carbon footprint” must exclude research and development.
S3.6 Supporting Material File
S3.6.1 The supporting material file is a document containing additional information which allows
the judges to understand the BOM. It should include drawings, exploded view drawings
and/or pictures of the vehicle and the parts included in the BOM.
S3.7 Cost and Emissions Explanation File
S3.7.1 The cost and emissions explanation file is a document which allows the judges to understand
the costs and greenhouse gas emissions within the CCBOM part of the BOM.
S3.7.2 The cost model used must be pointed out, especially which specific costs are included, e.g.
machine operation costs.
S3.7.3 The methodology used for determining the Global Warming Potential (GWP) in CO2e also
needs to be explained. The specific carbon emission factors associates with e.g one material
type need to be included.
S3.8 Cost and Manufacturing Scoring
S3.8.1 The team must present their vehicle according to S1.1 to score points in the cost and
manufacturing event.

S3.8.2 The cost and manufacturing event will be evaluated on the categories specified in the
following table:
Category Points
Part 1 “BOM Discussion” 50
Part 2 “Cost Understanding” 25
Part 3 “Real Case” 25
Total 100
S3.8.3 If items are missing from the BOM, points are deducted until 0 points are scored for “BOM
Discussion”.
S3.8.4 Some teams may be chosen to participate in the cost and manufacturing finals to determine
the cost and manufacturing event winner. The cost and manufacturing finals will be held
separately from the initial judging and teams will be informed about their participation during
the event.
S3.8.5 In case of finals the highest achievable scoring for the non-finalists is 80 points.
